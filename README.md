# Leadgeek Extension

> This tool is incomplete in its current state. I scrapped the project for business reasons as [Leadgeek v2](https://leadgeek.io) covers some of the intended functionality in a different way.

## Description

This is a Chrome extension that evaluates Amazon products in the context of arbitrage and wholesale. The intent behind this tool is to have a high degree of customization and performance to support unique evaluating experiences for individual 3rd party Amazon sellers.

This was the first project I used Svelte and Jest. I picked it because I knew I was going to make this project somewhat complex and I wanted a consistent and performant experience. Many of the intended users of this tool do not have high-end computers and I wanted the extension to run well for everyone, every time.

Some features I'd like to implement in the future are:

- Cross-browser (Safari/Firefox/Edge) extension support
- In-stock alerts from source retailers
- Integration with a web-app to work with a team and monitor items via a wishlist

This code is not to be reproduced and is intended for Leadgeek purposes only.
